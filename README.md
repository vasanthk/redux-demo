# Redux Demo
Playing around with [redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux).

> Predictable state container for JavaScript apps

### The Gist

> The whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store. The only way to change the state tree is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. To specify how the state tree is transformed by the actions, you write pure reducers.

### Main Principles

* The state of youer whole application is stored in an object tree inside a single store.

* State is read-only. The only way to mutate the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.

* Mutations are written as pure functions. To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
